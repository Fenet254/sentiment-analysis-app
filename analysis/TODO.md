# Sentiment Analysis App Development TODO

## 1. Clean up unnecessary files
- [x] Remove analysis/notebooks/train_model.ipynb
- [x] Update analysis/README.md with proper description

## 2. Finish model training
- [x] Create analysis/train.py script to load data, preprocess, train TF-IDF + LogisticRegression model, and save it

## 3. Improve preprocessing
- [x] Edit analysis/app/utils.py to enhance text preprocessing (e.g., remove stopwords, stemming)

## 4. Complete backend
- [x] Edit analysis/app/routes.py to add error handling, logging, prediction history (in session), batch prediction route

## 5. Enhance UI to be the most beautiful
- [x] Edit analysis/templates/index.html for modern layout with icons and animations
- [x] Edit analysis/static/css/style.css for stunning styles (gradients, responsive, animations)
- [x] Edit analysis/static/js/app.js for enhanced functionality (loading animations, history display, clear button)

## 6. Followup steps
- [ ] Run training script to generate model
- [ ] Test the app locally
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are installed
