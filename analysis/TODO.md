# UI Redesign Tasks

- [ ] Update `analysis/templates/index.html`: Wrap sections in `<section>` tags with card classes, improve semantics.
- [ ] Rewrite `analysis/static/css/style.css`: Define CSS variables for light theme, style cards with shadows and rounded corners, update buttons, inputs, result display, history, animations, remove glassmorphism and dark mode.
- [ ] Check `analysis/static/js/app.js`: Make minor adjustments if HTML classes/IDs changed.
- [ ] Run Flask app to test functionality and responsiveness.
- [ ] Verify JS interactions work with new styles.
